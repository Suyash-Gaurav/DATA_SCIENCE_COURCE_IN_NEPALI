	1 intro to course:

		    (1.0)Intro to cource :
					{
						1, what we will cover in this cource
						
					}
			(1.1),WHat is ai/intro to ai
					{
						data science vaneko k ho
						
						Ai ko defn

						ka use huncha

						importance k cha
					}

			(1.2)subsests of ai
					{
						machine learning(ML) VANEKO K HO
						
						deep learning (DL) VANEKO K HO
						

					}
			(1.3)difference bet ai ,ml ,dl
					{
						actually machine learning vaneko ai ko euta subset(tesko vitra parne) ani deep learning vnaeko chai machine learning ko subset
						ml use algorithm to preditc wherras deep learning use artificial neural network ANN. It is inspired from the neurons of brain.
						
					}
			(1.4)what is ml
					(1.4.1) types of ml
						{
							THere are 3 types of ml :
								1, Supervised learning
								2, Unsupervised Learning
								3, Reinforcement Learning
						}
			(1.5)Discription of the types
				{
					what is supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning?
					{
						why it is used exapmle
						famous algorithm	
					}
					
					
				}
			(1.6)selecting programming language
				{
					huna ta dherai chan language for data science jastai c++ , java , c, R, Scala
					tara hami python nai kina garne
					
				}
